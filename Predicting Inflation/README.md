## Overview
This project is an implementation of my thesis in the mathematics department. Its aim is to predict future inflation values based on previous inflation data. The model used in this project is Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a simple web app for prediction has been created using Shiny.

## Key Components
Data Source: BPS Sulawesi Utara
Programming Language: R
Modeling Technique: Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Web Framework: Shiny

## Step by step in this project
1. Data Acquisition and EDA:
- Gathered inflation data from BPS Sulawesi Utara.
- Explored data characteristics through exploratory analysis.
2. Feature Engineering:
- Created new feature based on plot PACF
3. Model Development:
- Trained an SVR model to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model accuracy.
4. Web App Development:
- Built an simple Shiny web application using R.
- Enabled users to make prediction.
